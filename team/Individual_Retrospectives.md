# Individual Retrospectives

We meet regularly to give each other feedback. Some companies call these meetings "1-on-1s," but we usually refer to them as "Individual Retrospectives" (or IRs) to convey their mission of retrospection and improvement.

## Purpose
We believe that candid, constructive feedback amongst teammates provides the foundation for a good working relationship and individual improvement.

Why a meeting? Why not gather up feedback and hand it to management for performance reviews or simply point out issues as they arise? It's best to deliver feedback firsthand when possible. When you give feedback through a 3rd party, the message may be miscommunicated and the recipient has limited ability to seek clarification. On the other hand, your teammates might find spontaneous critical feedback jarring if they're not prepared for it; possibly more so if you haven't adequately prepared it. When you're engaged in your work, it's easy to misinterpret the magnitude of unexpected feedbackâ€“either taking it too harshly or dismissing it as unimportant. Setting aside time to directly exchange feedback allows both parties to prepare for it and give it the discussion it warrants.

## Format
IRs tend to be informal. You can grab a conference room or go out for coffee or lunch (reimbursable, subject to our lunch budget). For your very first meeting with a teammate, I'd recommend scheduling at least half an hour and planning to have somewhere quiet to sit, so that you can focus on your communication and take notes. For subsequent meetings, you might find a short walk, coffee, or a lunch chat more efficient.

In these meetings, your goal is to discuss how you're working together. Specifically, you'll want to talk about things that are going well and things that could use improvement in your working relationship. Note taking is encouraged and you should follow up on any actions you discussed at your previous IR. Here's an agenda suggestion:

* Review any actions from your previous IR
* Person A gives person B feedback
* Feedback discussion, clarification, and action generation
* Person B gives person A feedback
* Feedback discussion, clarification, and action generation
* Action summary and closing thoughts

The actual agenda is up to you. You'll find more suggestions for getting started in the guidelines below.

## Rules
* If you have feedback about a possible HR violation, please see HR and/or your manager before giving the feedback. This includes, but is not limited to, racism, sexism, sexually-inappropriate behavior, gross misconduct, etc. These are topics that you should not try to handle by yourself. If you're at all uncertain whether a topic falls into the category of "HR violations", ask HR or your manager for guidance.
* The feedback you give must be constructive. If you're frustrated or you have a complaint that you're unable to couch in constructive, actionable terms, talk to your manager before engaging your teammate.
* You must be open to receiving constructive feedback. IRs cannot serve their purpose if you cannot graciously receive feedback. This does not mean that you have to agree with the feedback. Ultimately, you get to decide what to act upon and what to reject. You are welcome to ask for clarification and specifics, but you shouldn't argue. If you disagree with feedback that you're given and clarification isn't changing your mind, simply say something along the lines of "thanks for that feedback, I need some time to think about it," and move on. If you are giving feedback and you encounter such a deflection, you should not push the issue. If either of you leave the IR thinking that an unresolved problem remains, discuss it with your manager.

## Guidelines
* IRs are meant to be "1-on-1". They're for sharing individualized feedback.
Topics can include anything that impacts your professional relationship. Communication styles/preferences, how/whether to interrupt one another with questions, work quality, body odor, professionalism, etc. are all valid topics.
* Managers should have IRs with their direct reports about once every two weeks.
* Teammates who are actively working together should have IRs at least once every month. Consider scheduling more frequent IRs with teammates with whom you're interacting on a daily basis and less frequent IRs with teammates with whom you're interacting on a weekly basis. If you're not interacting with a teammate on at least a weekly basis, you probably don't need to schedule a recurring IR with them--though you could schedule a one-off IR if you have specific feedback to give.
* Some feedback is hard to give--especially around personal topics such as body odor or general hygiene. If you feel like you're struggling to give important feedback, talk to your manager about it. Your manager can help you frame the feedback constructively and practice giving it until you're comfortable. Or, if it's hopelessly outside of your comfort zone, they can figure out how to give it for you.
* Don't gossip or complain. IRs can be bonding experiences, but don't use them as opportunities to vent about what everyone else is doing wrong. If your teammate is complaining to you about another teammate or manager, suggest that they schedule an IR to give that person feedback. If they're complaining about their job, suggest that they hold an IR with their manager.
* To prepare during the weeks leading up to your IR, jot down notes whenever a teammate does something you think is great or whenever they annoy you, they make more work for you or the team, you have an awkward interaction, etc. Before your IR, review your notes and distill them down to 2-3 things you think they did well and 2-3 things you think need improvement. When possible, try to come up with proposed actions for each point. This gives a starting point for discussion, while also helping you determine if your feedback is actionable.
* Give actionable feedback. Ideally, you'd suggest an action for each piece of feedback you give; however, if you can't think of one, give the feedback and ask your teammate to help you quickly brainstorm actions. Also, be open to action counter-proposals from your teammate. It's good to have an action in mind when giving feedback, but introspective teammates might have more context about the cause of their behavior and they might be able to suggest an action that will be more effective for them than the one you had in mind.
* Positive feedback frequently takes the form of non-actionable kudos. This is fine, but look for opportunities to take good work to the next level. For example, "Your presentation was really good! You conveyed the topic clearly and everyone was engaged. Do you have any tricks you used to prepare that you'd feel comfortable sharing with the team?" or "That report was stellar. The document flow was superb and your points were well-supported. Can we share it with the rest of the team as an example of how a report should be done? Also, the document itself was beautiful and well-organized. Do you think you could turn it into a template that we could reuse?" Note that neither of those examples employed a pattern of, "your work was great, except for..." If you have critical feedback to give, give it as such and don't disguise it as positive feedback.
* Keep in mind that not all perceived issues are real issues. The goal of an IR is to work better together, not to create actions for change's sake. You will occasionally give feedback with which the recipient disagrees. If you're open to their perspective when discussing this, you will hopefully arrive at the root of the misunderstanding and learn something about how to communicate more effectively with your teammate.
* If you're at a loss for critical feedback, ask your teammate to share things that they think they could improve. If they share an issue that you haven't observed or that you don't perceive to be a problem, let them know. If you have observed the issue, help them brainstorm actions.
* Crave critique. If you're only ever getting positive feedback, try forcing the issue: "I really appreciate the positive feedback, but I'd like you to tell me one thing that I need to do better. Take your time to think about it. I'll wait." Reward your teammate's effort with gratitude when they eventually think of something.
* If you and a teammate are both consistently at a loss for feedback, 1) ensure you're giving yourselves enough time to prepare and 2) reflect upon whether you're actually working closely together. Consider reducing the frequency of your IRs if you're not.
