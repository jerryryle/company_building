# Team Retrospectives
We hold a monthly, all-hands retrospective meeting. You should have received an invitation to this meeting as part of your company onboarding. If you have not, reach out to X to add you to the meeting.

## Purpose
We believe that we must improve consciously and with intention. We believe that our processes should facilitate rather than encumber. We believe that our tools and environment should work for us rather than against us. We believe that we should remain skeptical about our beliefs. Because we hold these beliefs, we gather on a regular basis to review our processes, tools, and environment to determine what, if anything, needs improvement and to create an improvement plan.

Why a meeting? Why not point out issues as they arise or gather them into a suggestion box that management reviews? Constant debate distracts us from our core mission and "suggestion boxes" are impotent. Everyone must feel empowered and responsible for raising critical issues at any time, but we've found that we're more effective at synthesizing learnings and acting upon them when we set aside time to do so. Our retrospective meetings are the time and place for critique, debate, synthesis, and strategy.

## Format
We begin by evaluating actions from our last retrospective. If we feel that an action has not yielded the desired outcome, we add it to the topic list for this retrospective. We then hold an open call for topics, followed by a vote if we don't think we can cover all topics within the hour. We rank the topics by vote count and cover as many as possible. For each topic, we have a short discussion of the issue, gather ideas for improvement, and choose one or more actions (by consensus or vote). The output of the meeting should be a list of actions that will impart change. We evaluate the outcome of those actions at the next retrospective.

## Rule
While we can choose to change the format, frequency, or attendees of retrospectives as we grow, we cannot cancel them altogether. Retrospectives are our one mandatory process element. Without them, we risk stagnation and dysfunction.

## Guidelines
* Topics can include anything from how we communicate to where the printer is located. If something is bothering you while you're working or you have a really positive experience, jot down some notes and bring these to the retrospective.
* Topics can be negative or positive. Ask yourself what's getting in your way, but also what's working really well. Can we do less of the former and more of the latter? This is important. Fixing issues is obviously critical, but discovery, recognition, and dissemination of new, better ways of doing things is important to our growth.
* Discussion is often streamlined if you can bring at least one concrete suggestion along with a topic. That is, try to have an action in mind when proposing a topic. However, if you can't think of any reasonable actions to propose, don't let that stop you from raising the issue and asking the team to help you brainstorm actions.
* It's okay to critique the retrospective itself.
* Team Retrospective topics should not be focused upon individual growth. Save those topics for Individual Retrospectives with your managers and peers.
* Retrospectives should run no longer than an hour. Sometimes topics won't have a simple resolution. Consider explicitly acknowledging these for what they are, hold a quick debate to understand the key arguments and stakeholders, and schedule a dedicated meeting with a subset of the team to resolve them.
